# OpenGL Game Engine - WIP

This project started with the idea of making my assignments faster to code. Instead of reusing bad written code I focused on developing this tool that could make render and move objects easier.

Due to the amount of work of the Master that I am doing, this project is still not finished and a lot of new features have to be added to convert it into a fully functional engine.

### Demo Projects

- [MipMapping](https://youtu.be/TsZA2yeeR8w)
- [Rendering Styles (Refraction and Reflection)](https://youtu.be/G2UApdAjK6k)
- [Particles](https://youtu.be/OrJ3MiT1Vhc)
- [Rendering Styles (Phong, Gooch & Cartoon)](https://youtu.be/dhwIXdvvFHY)
- [Rotations (Euler and Quaternions / Hierarchical)](https://youtu.be/HpgOAALAXjU)
- [First Demo](https://youtu.be/ZkJKG76QycA)
